TODO:
- Add profile picture, replace placeholders with user's profile pictures
- Add user page
- Document root for a hrefs. Logout for admin isn't working since it's linking to /admin/logout.php
- Verify if user has access to current forum
- Verify if user has access to current topic
- Add/enable HTTPS (research how it works first xD )

IDEA:
- In user settings, toggle between "Last post in forum" and "Last unread post in forum" or maybe even "Last unread post in tracked topics" (maybe even toggle per category and/or per forum)

DONE:
- Do login with email rather than username
- Make LOGIN and REGISTER buttons actually toggle, rather than only open the portal. If login is open and login is clicked, login should close
