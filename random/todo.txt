IN PROGRESS

SMALL:
- Write function to send emails
- More information in emails (who is the user, what is the email about, what website is the email from)
- Fix user links (once user pages have been implemented)

MEDIUM:
- Make errors prettier
- Make emails prettier
- Make datepicker prettier (Settings->Profile->Birthdate)
- Settings->Profile form: on submit, page refreshes to Security tab, rather than Profile tab. [BUG]
- Fix/remove glyphicons from Admin tables [BUG]
- Portal doesn't show up outside index.php [BUG]
- Add user page (public profile)
- Form validation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#server-side)
- Rework location display in navbar
- Order topics by time since last post when displaying
- After X attempts at logging in, wait Y seconds before you can retry logging in to prevent spamming

BIG:
- Public user profile
- Redo portal (https://andwecode.com/create-popup-login-and-signup-form/#live)
- Routes (clean URL)

IDEA:
- Night mode (https://bootswatch.com/darkly/)
- Hover over time since to show exact date/time
- Verify if user has access to current forum
- Verify if user has access to current topic
- Take a look at session_regenerate_id (https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php)
- Add/enable HTTPS (research how it works first xD )
- In user settings, toggle between "Last post in forum" and "Last unread post in forum" or maybe even "Last unread post in tracked topics" (maybe even toggle per category and/or per forum)

DONE:
- Make settings show the users' own information (username, email address, birthdate etc)
- Display users' current username and email address on settings page
- Send email when changing password
- Send email when changing username
- Send email when changing email address
- Implement mail system for activation of account after registration
- Implement mail system for reset password
- Reset password (when not logged in)
- Visiting forum.php or topic.php without $_GET['id'] results in many errors [BUG]
- Add titles to pages
- Visitors not logged in can visit settings.php [BUG]
- Direct visitor back to previous page if possible when logging out
- MySQL error when deleting non-empty forum
- Implement "change username" to Settings
- Add backend to Settings->Profile
- Images table only works for 1 on 1. Type & foreign_id is not a unique identifier anymore as soon as there's a post (or entity in general) with multiple images
- Add profile picture, replace placeholders with user's profile pictures (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8922056/what-is-the-best-way-to-upload-and-store-pictures-on-the-site)
- Document root for a hrefs. Logout for admin isn't working since it's linking to /admin/logout.php (fixed it by adding / to hrefs etc, apparently that refers to root). require_once however needed $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] (http://yagudaev.com/posts/resolving-php-relative-path-problem/).
- Sanitise HTML output (htmlspecialchars)
- Replace all evaluations of $_SESSION['loggedin'] etc by isLoggedIn() function
- Order categories by priority when displaying
- Do login with email rather than username
- Make LOGIN and REGISTER buttons actually toggle, rather than only open the portal. If login is open and login is clicked, login should close
